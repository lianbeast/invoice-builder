Invoice Builder is an **offline-first, open-source invoicing and quoting application** for freelancers and small businesses. No accounts, no cloud, no subscriptions — your data stays on your machine in a database file you own, with an optional self-hosted web/Docker mode for multi-device access.

> **⚠️ One-time upgrade notice for version 3.0.2**
> Before upgrading, back up each existing database and make sure it completed migrations through version 2.10.0. Version 3.0.2 initializes new databases from a consolidated schema and does not include the historical migration chain, so databases with incomplete migrations are not upgraded. This applies to Electron, manual, and web/Docker upgrades.

## What it does

- Create and manage **Invoices** and **Quotes** with live PDF preview, A4/Letter formats, and a drag-and-drop Visual Layout Builder
- Manage Businesses, Clients, Banks, Items, Categories, Units, and Currencies, each with XLSX import/export
- Flexible financials: surcharges, discounts, shipping, inclusive/exclusive tax, partial payments, and document states
- Export invoices as UBL 2.1 / Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 or XRechnung XML for compliant e-invoicing
- Native receipt printing (desktop) and browser print-to-PDF receipts (web/Docker)
- Full database backup/restore, JSON export/import, and per-document data snapshots for historical accuracy
- Runs as a desktop app (Windows, Linux, macOS) backed by SQLite, or self-hosted via Docker with SQLite or PostgreSQL

## Quick start

**Desktop:** download the latest build for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/piratuks/invoice-builder/releases).
